### SUMMARY

_The William F. Cody Archive: Documenting the life and times of Buffalo Bill_ is a project developed together by the McCracken Research Library at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. This archive holds important information of American national development, specifically the American west, from the late nineteenth-century to the early twentieth-century. In this digital archive, users will find biographies, illustrations, topics covering “Buffalo Bill” himself, as well as much more. 

### HUMANISTIC CLAIM

As a historical project the archive of William F. Cody includes the humanities topics of history and politics. Cody was a man who took roles during his lifetime as a community founder, businessman, and rancher, as well as an investor who spoke on political, economic, and environmental policies that were affecting the western development. All of the tabs you will find on the home page of this project will lead users to the experiences Cody had throughout his life in hopes to make as much material available to the public as possible so people may learn about him. This archive strives to show users the historic evolution and idealization of the American west through the viewpoint of William F. Cody, better known as “Buffalo Bill.”

### PROJECT DESIGN 

I really enjoyed how the project partners organized the collected information for the _William F. Cody Archive_ as well as how the design was laid out. The collected information is organized into eight main sections; life, texts, topics, images, scholarship, memorabilia, community, and multimedia which is very easy to navigate and is clear as to where the different topics of information are located. When browsing through any of these eight sections users will find a variety of sub-tabs that will point them in the right direction when/if searching for something more specific under the main topic. 
 
When first browsing through the website the user can see there are ten various tabs all showcasing different topics of information one can look at. These navigation tabs highlight when the user hovers their mouse over them, and once they click one one, it takes them to a new page with new information to browse through. For example, when selecting the “Life” tab the browser will take the user to a new page with four new subsections; biographies, personography, chronology, and encyclopedia. Within these four tabs the user will find all the information available about that topic, which is a great way to ensure that users are finding all the information available to them.

I find this digital project to be very organized and easy to navigate for individuals of all technical proficiencies. The website's easy navigation is also in credit to the wide array of sub-tabs after clicking on the main tabs. For example, when clicking on the “Life” tab, four additional  subsections come up with specific 
information pertaining to the main topics that help guide you to the information you are looking for.  

Because this digital humanities project is so large and holds a wide variety of information, I think it was beneficial for the site to have a search bar in the bottom left side of the tab selection. Once the user clicks the search bar tab the website takes you to a place where you can type in keywords such as “life” which would pull up all the information in the project that relates to William F. Cody’s life. 

Users also have the option to search the finder bar where they can type in a specific person or place they are interested in. If you are already in one of the other tabs (i.e. life, topics, scholarship) the search bar will then move toward the top left of the browser. If the user is unsure of who they are looking for or what places they want to learn more about, the search tab for “People” will provide an alphabetical list of each person included in this project to choose from, and the search tab for “Places” will provide an alphabetical list of each place included in this project. 

### TECHNOLOGY USED/DEVELOPED

Under the multimedia tab there are two sections listed. One section leads you to audio clips featuring Cody himself, who at the time was a well-known celebrity who was convinced by pioneers of sound to make recordings used for demonstration and commercial use. The second section leads you to various video clips that Cody made when given the opportunity to create films such as documentary-style films. These video clips are made accessible by TEI encoded XML youtube videos. 

The audio and video clips do not have dates and are therefore placed in a random order sequence, which I do not think is great in terms of usability. When clicking on an audio clip, it will come up with a recording file where it shows you the longevity of the audio as well as a play button to start it when you please. The user is able to click the three dots next to the volume button on the recording file where they will find options to download the audio file and change the playback speed. There is also an inclusion of text underneath the recording that is accessible for individuals to follow along with or for individuals who are hard of hearing.

The download option was a great detail to add for those who are using this DH project for a class project or research so they can easily download and use the audio recording in their own documents. Being able to change the playback speed is also very beneficial to users who have a hard time processing information and may need to slow the recording down to fully understand what they are listening to. The ability to change the playback speed combined with the inclusion of text underneath the recording allows people with disabilities to use this project for research/information as well.

Unfortunately in the video clip part of the multimedia section has some problematic issues. Although each youtube video played and the audio worked, there was no closed caption option available as well as no scripted text for users to follow. This could end up being a problem because of how old the videos are and how scratchy some of the audio sounds. Without closed caption or scripted text for users to follow along with while watching the video there is no way users can be sure if what they are hearing is accurate and if they are receiving all the information the video provides. This would also be a problem for those who are hard of hearing or have other disabilities. 

Something I personally enjoyed and found interesting while browsing through this project was the “Images” tab. This tab includes photographs from illustrations from mass-produced books, photographs of Cody and his family, postcards from _Buffalo Bill's Wild West Tours_, visual art that include Cody as the subject or that Cody commissioned himself, posters from _Buffalo Bill’s Wild West_ exhibitions, and cabinet cards of Cody from different years. Many individuals are visual learners and the inclusion of these images helped users paint a picture of William F. Cody and the time period he lived in. 

### CONCLUSION

Overall, this project was very easy to navigate through, especially to those who may be new to the digital humanities. The inclusion of the eight tabs on the home page which split up the information was a great way to organize the information from this project. The idea of a search bar was also beneficial in finding my way around such a big project. I really appreciated how there were sub tabs underneath the main tabs which made it easy to find the information I was looking for. As a visual learner, I also really enjoyed the variety of pictures included in the “Images” tab as well as the youtube videos included in the video section of the “Multimedia” tab despite their not being closed captions or scripted text to follow along with. This archive on William F. (Buffalo Bill) Cody was done exceptionally well and certainly brings Cody’s history to life.
