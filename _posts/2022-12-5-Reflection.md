## What does Digital Humanities mean to me?
When I registered for this class, I had an entirely different view of what it would entail. As a communication major, I thought this class would focus on social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc., and go more in-depth about the impact they have on society, but I was way off base with that assumption. After taking this course, I understand that it is a class about an academic field that focuses on applying digital tools and methods to what we know of traditional humanities subjects such as literature and history. So, yes, my definition of digital humanities has abruptly changed over the past three months. Although the class is not entirely what I expected, I feel like I have gained so much knowledge that will ultimately benefit me and my future endeavors as a communication major.

## What assignments did I enjoy/struggle with? 
Out of all the assignments we have completed in this class, I would say my favorite one and the one I most enjoyed would be the lean canvas and ideation assignments. The grant project is one we had expected all semester and when the time finally came to create a project which interests us, I was very excited. I chose to incorporate my love for travel writing and journalism by completing a digital humanities project on Ernest Hemingway. Now, the reason the lean canvas and ideation assignments were my favorite is that this was the start of our thought process for our assignments and a way to put our creativity on paper, or in my case on Canva. I loved seeing what I visualized in my head come to life, and I think it inspired/motivated me to finish my final grant.

As for an assignment I struggled with, I’d say it wasn’t necessarily the assignment, but the way in which we were completing it. GitHub was very difficult for me to use and navigate at the start. I am in no way a computer wizard and having to code and apply images to my review blog posts was challenging. It seemed every time I started to understand and get the hang of the coding techniques, some new issue would arise. Over time, and with practice, I had a much easier time with GitHub and with coding, and now I can say I am proficient in a new system.

## Have I grown as a writer/reader/student/Digital humanist?
I have most definitely seen the growth and development of my writing skills throughout my time in this course. Most of our assignments included writing in a blog format and it pushed me to learn more about my writing style and what worked for me as a student. I am thankful for any practice I receive when it comes to writing because of my hopes to one day be a traveling environmental photojournalist. As a student, I have gained knowledge on how to be a convincing writer, how to keep paragraphs short and to the point, how to write a review blog without writing a summary, and most importantly, how to better organize the information I am wanting to include.

## Conclusion
Overall, I am glad my initial assumption about the class was wrong because if I had known, I probably wouldn’t have taken it. But now, since I have, I am grateful for the lessons it has given me and the knowledge I have gained and will take with me throughout my life in the communication/media fields. This class may not be for everyone, but I can say it is one of those courses that will benefit you in more ways than just learning about the digital humanities. It has made me a better writer, a better peer-reviewer for my fellow classmates, and more proficient in coding, all of which make me a better, more well-rounded student.
