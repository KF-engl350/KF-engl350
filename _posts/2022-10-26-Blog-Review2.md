# Summary 
After much research and consideration, I have decided to review the project _“Mapping Isabella Bird: Geolocation & Unbeaten Tracks in Japan”_, created by Christina M. Spiker. The purpose of this project is to educate students, educators, and researchers on the history of who Isabella Bird is. This digital humanities project is focused on Birds travel story, _“Unbeaten Tracks in Japan”_ where Spiker includes a table of contents including ten different sections users can click on to learn more about Isabella Bird. 

# Humanistic Claims
This project includes the topics of travel writing, english, and history. Not only does this project on Isabella Bird include maps, images, stories, and a brief biography about who she was, but it also includes an illustration gallery of her book _Unbeaten Tracks in Japan_. This illustration gallery helps users form a deeper understanding of the places she traveled to in Japan as well as why this project is informative for those who specifically enjoy travel writing, english, and history. This digital humanities project brings this piece by Isabella Bird to life and enhances the topics of humanities it involves. I found this project to be easily accessible to its users and easy to navigate through. I also appreciate that this project is available to those other than scholars which encourages a variety of people to have conversations about the project.

# Project Design 
The interactive maps found in this digital humanities project on Isabella Birds story, _Unbeaten Tracks in Japan_, are created by tabular data (spreadsheets) selected from free historical texts found online from websites such as Archive.org and HathiTrust Digital Library. The information found and used from this site on this project is then put into a visual format by geospatial mapping applications. These applications include but are not limited to CARTO, ArcGIS, Mapbox, Leaflet, and StoryMapJS.

# Technology Used/Developed
![Table of Contents](https://kf-engl350.github.io/KF-engl350/Images/ReviewBlogtwo.png)

This project does a great job of using the technology available to advance its goals. Under the table of contents tab located in the top left corner of the home page, there is a list of ten options a user may choose from. The title of these ten tabs are; About, Isabella Bird: A Brief Biography, Writing on the World Stage, Traveling to Japan, Interactive Map Collection, Illustrating the Book, Why Unbeaten Tracks?, Biratori & Bird’s Account of Ainu Culture, The Saru River Valley Today, and Citation & Resources. There is also a button users can click under the title featured on the home page called “Begin with “Isabella Bird: A Brief Biography” that will guide users through the project section by section. This is beneficial to users who are not familiar with the project and want to explore everything it has to offer.

I found that the technology was easy to navigate as a new user. I appreciated how the project had a button located at the end of each section that led me to the next. This allowed me to learn more about Isabella Bird’s history in the order that it happened and the order that Spiker felt was best. I feel that if there was no button to click at the end of each section, I would be very confused about the order of events and what happened first. It also allowed me to understand what events happened as a result of something else that happened.

The technology used to develop this project impressed me as a user because of how easy it was to use when browsing through the project's table of contents. As I mentioned previously, there are buttons at the bottom of each section that will direct the user to the next section, and with that, it will eventually lead the user to the main portion of this project which is the mapping section. There are eight maps total listed next to the number 5 or the “Interactive Map Collection” in the table of contents. The nice thing about this section is that instead of bringing the user to the first map straightaway it brings you to essentially a homepage that includes a short summary of the section. Next, it lists each interactive map title and a short description informing users what geospatial mapping application was used and what each map includes. 

I really enjoyed that each map available had different colored pin dots on certain locations that gave descriptions of the place or a quote from _Unbeaten Tracks in Japan_ to show the purpose for its inclusion on the map. On some of the maps there is even a color guide for the color of the dots found on the map that separates each region by color. For example, on the interactive map on Isabella in Japan, there is a map key in the top left corner that shows the blue dots represent the regions of Yokahama to Niigata.

Something neat that this project includes that many others I viewed do not is a place for users to voice their concerns about the site as well as give advance as to what they could do to make it better. For example, in the table of contents listed next to the number 6 is the title, “Illustrating the Book”. When arriving at this page users can click on the “Annotated Images” section and scroll down highlighted red section that says, “Not all sourced images have been discovered at this time and your help is needed.” It then goes on to say if the user notices that a photo has not been annotated they can scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the speech bubble and make a comment, or they can click the highlighted words that tell users to get in touch via email. Unfortunately, the embedded link for getting in touch via email leads to a page that cannot be found. This link error takes away from a user involvement that could be beneficial to the betterment of the project. 

	Although this project makes note of some of the errors, such as its lack of annotations on pictures used, there are still some other things I have noticed that could be improved. Some of these improvements could be fixing grammatical errors in paragraphs, fixing awkward sentences, and having the photos featured in the “Illustration Gallery” tab go straight to the media page instead of the media file. An example of a grammatical error I encountered would be in the section titled “Biratori & Bird’s Account of Ainu Culture”, where the first sentence says, “One of ways that Bird's travelogue is unique when compared to those of her contemporaries is the sheer amount of text she devotes to descriptions of  in Hokkaido, or "Yezo."





# Impact
This project created by Christina M. Spiker relates to and will be beneficial to reference when creating my project in many ways. This mapping project is about Isabella Bird, an English travel writer, who documented her travels from Tokyo to Hokkaido in 1878. For my project, I am also reviewing and creating a mapping project but on Ernest Hemmingway, an American writer, who wrote many novels about his travels to other countries just like Isabella Bird. The story I chose to for my digital humanities project is called, “Green Hills of Africa" which is a story Ernest and his wife Pauline's trip to Africa in December of 1933.

I choose this protect to review because it is also a mapping project about a well-known travel writer with the inclusion of a bibliography and many other sections that educates me about her life as well as where she went in Japan that inspired her to write her book _Unbeaten Tracks in Japan_. This project has shown me what I want and do not want to include in my digital humanities project as well as what works and does not work when incorporating mapping into a digital humanities project. 

Before conducting research to find a topic that I wanted to create a project out of, I always struggled to find projects that taught me about the history of travel writing. I feel that my project is necessary to educate those, like me, that have a passion for traveling, reading about traveling, studying travel writers like Ernest Hemmigway’s experiences, and overall learning something new about the topic.
