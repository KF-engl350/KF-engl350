# Summary 
After much research and consideration, I have decided to review the project “Mapping Isabella Bird: Geolocation & Unbeaten Tracks in Japan”, created by Christina M. Spiker. The purpose of this project is to educate students, educators, and researchers on the history of who Isabella Bird is. This digital humanities project is focused on Birds travel story, “Unbeaten Tracks in Japan” where Spiker includes a table of contents including ten different sections users can click on to learn more about Isabella Bird. 

# Humanistic Claims
This project includes the topics of travel writing, english, and history. Not only does this project on Isabella Bird include maps, images, stories, and a brief biography about who she was, but the site also includes an illustration gallery of her book Unbeaten Tracks in Japan. This illustration gallery helps users form a deeper understanding of the places she traveled to in Japan as well as why this project is informative for those who specifically enjoy travel writing, english, and history. This digital humanities project brings this piece by Isabella Bird to life and enhances the topics of humanities it involves. I found this project to be easily accessible to its users and easy to navigate through. I also appreciate that this project is available to those other than scholars which encourages a variety of people to have conversations about Isabella Bird.
